Both the men and women wear their hair in two braids. One braid over each ear which usually fall below the shoulder. Arafellin were generally considered 'touchy' and the men regularly fight duels. The choice of weapon goes to the one challenged. They are known to be creative with the choice such as fighting in a dark room. The women fight duels as well, though rarely, and deny they have done so if they did. Women don't use swords but have been known to use knives, whips, and lances. The primary exports are timber and furs. They also have several gem stone mines that produce firedrops and other gems, as well as gold and silver mines. Like all borderlands it is illegal to hide your face in a town as a defense against fades, and the towns all have lamps lit during the night."
