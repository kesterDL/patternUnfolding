          <p>A land of light, where freedom dreamed.</p>
          <p>Aemon stood, his heart of flame,</p>
          <p>Eldrene’s beauty, a whispered name.</p>

          <p>Through fields of gold, through forests green,</p>
          <p>Manetheren stood, a mighty queen.</p>

          <p>Bravery lost in the Shadow’s thunder.</p>
          <p>Betrayed by those who swore to stand,</p>
          <p>We fought alone for our sacred land.</p>

          <p>The Red Eagle soared, a beacon bright,</p>
          <p>Through endless war, through endless night.</p>
          <p>The Shadow came with a thousand cries,</p>
          <p>Under darkened skies, the hope still lies.</p>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="c2">
        <span>
          <p>We marched for home, through blood and stone,</p>
          <p>To find our land besieged, alone.</p>

          <p>The shepherds fought where the shadow laid.</p>
          <p>The women stood with hearts of steel,</p>
          <p>Their love for home a burning seal.</p>

          <p>Aemon fell, the Red Eagle torn,</p>
          <p>Her fiery wrath consumed them all,</p>
          <p>The Shadow fled, but so did all.</p>

          <p>Bravery and love carved into its name.</p>
          <p>No stone remains, but the blood will stay,</p>
          <p>Manetheren lives in hearts this day.</p>

          <p>Through whispered songs and ancient tales,</p>
          <p>The Red Eagle flies, where courage prevails.</p>
          <p>Though the land is gone, its soul won’t fade,</p>
          <p>Manetheren’s spirit will never be swayed.</p>
